# US-Music-Trend-Analyzer


## Introduction (Data):
This project aims to uncover trends in the American popular music scene. We begin by collecting data on the top 100 songs in America for the years 2013 to 2023. Each song will be accompanied with data from Spotify API and other data sources to collect information about the song including but not limited to genre, release date, popularity, as well as information on the artists themselves. Using tools such as Textblob, we can also determine a sentiment score for each song by analyzing the lyrics and giving it a score between -1 for sad and +1 for happy. We will also collect data on significant events during those years in America and categorize them using OpenAI API, which is built to understand human text and understand sentiment. With this data we can see how events in history affect popular music trends in America.
